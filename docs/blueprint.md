## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#3F5D38) for a natural and focused feel, evocative of the golf course. Chosen because a key objective of playing golf is reaching the 'green'.
- Background color: Light beige (#F2F1E6), very desaturated, complements forest green.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#E6E091) to highlight important elements.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif with an elegant style
- Body font: 'Alegreya' serif for comfortable readability in longer text. Chosen as pairing for Belleza.
- Use simple, clear icons from Lucide to represent different aspects of golf and practice, prioritizing consistency.
- Cards with rounded corners and subtle shadows organize content and give a modern feel.
